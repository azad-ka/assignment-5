            <h4>Question-1: What are the different ways to select an element in DOM?</h4>
            <p>We can select an element in DOM many ways. They are given bellow-
                <br>
                1. getElementById(id)
                <br>
                2.getElementsByClassName(className)
                <br>
                3. getElementsByTagName(tagName)
                <br>
                4. querySelector(selector)
                <br>
                5. querySelectorAll(selector)

            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Question-2: What is the difference between innerText, innerHTML and textContent?</h4>
            <p>When we use innerText we can get or even set text from the selected element. But if we use innerHTML then
                we can get and set new html content from the selected element. we can set new tags with innerHTML.
                textContent property returns or sets the text from the selected element. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Question-3: What is event delegation in the DOM?</h4>
            <p>Event delegation in JavaScript is a pattern that efficiently handles events. Events can be added to a
                parent element instead of adding to every single element. It refers to the process of using event
                propagation to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event
                originated.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Question-4: What is event bubbling in the DOM?</h4>
            <p>Event bubbling in the DOM is an event propagation method. An event triggered on a child element
                propagates upward through its ancestors in the DOM tree. It allows parent elements to respond to events
                triggered by their child elements.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Question-5: How do you create, add, and remove element using JavaScript?</h4>
            <p>We use following methods to to create, add, and remove an element using JavaScript- 
                1. create element: document.createElement()
                <br>
                2. add element: appendChild()
                <br>
                3. remove element: remove()
            </p>
